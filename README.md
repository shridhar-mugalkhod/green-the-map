# Garbage Management Project

## Introduction

The rapid increase in the production of waste has led to an upsurge of "black spots" in our cities. Garbage management has become a major concern and a menace, plaguing not only our city but the entire country. It has also become a significant issue in the broader context of environmental problems. It is high time that we address this issue effectively and combat it with innovative solutions.

## Project Overview

Our project is designed to tackle the issue of effective garbage management. We have developed an innovative solution that combines Machine Learning, Image Processing, and IoT (Internet of Things) technologies. Additionally, we have used PHP and MySQL for building a web interface that complements the core functionalities of our project.

## Key Features

Our project aims to provide a comprehensive solution for garbage management. Some of the key features and components of our solution include:

1. **Machine Learning:** We have implemented Machine Learning algorithms to automate and enhance garbage classification and sorting. This technology helps in categorizing waste into different types, making the disposal process more efficient.

2. **Image Processing:** Image processing techniques are employed to process images captured from the garbage collection points. This allows for real-time analysis and monitoring of garbage levels and conditions.

3. **IoT Integration:** We have incorporated Internet of Things (IoT) devices to enable smart and real-time monitoring of garbage bins. These devices transmit data to our system, allowing for timely collection and optimization of routes for garbage trucks.

4. **Web Interface:** We have developed a user-friendly web application using PHP and MySQL, providing an intuitive platform for users, administrators, and waste management personnel. Users can report issues, monitor garbage collection schedules, and access real-time data.

## How It Works

Our project operates in the following steps:

1. **Garbage Monitoring:** IoT sensors placed in garbage bins collect data on the level of waste. Image processing is used to monitor the condition of the garbage.

2. **Classification and Sorting:** Machine Learning algorithms automatically classify the type of waste and prioritize collection based on various factors.

3. **Data Analysis:** Real-time data from the sensors and image processing are processed and analyzed to optimize collection schedules and routes.

4. **User Interaction:** Users can access the web interface to report issues, view collection schedules, and monitor the status of garbage collection points.
